# Portfolio 



### Existing issues

**Portfolio page** `/`

* BUG: Navigation is not click through when mouse is hovering over work, it's fixed-top and contains 100% width. Should perhaps be only logo width based on `onComplete` for navigation animation
* BUG: Oncomplete background animation the work is shown. Should be a more smooth reveal  
* BUG: Navigation animation is anchored to 100vh - if you refresh the page while at the bottom the navigationbar is still shown. Should be anchored to top of work div
* TODO: Beautify the Tippy box when hovering over work
* TODO: Make locale extension
* TODO: Make a proper footer - find inspiration on a simple approach
  * Maybe some animation for extra wow effect

**Work page (KOPRA) `/kopra`**

* BUG: Navigation bar hides upon loading - perhaps it should be hidden?
* TODO: Create hover over effect on device mockup one page
* TODO: Create animations and add some decorative elements
* TODO: Find proper font and make it concurrent on the whole page
* TODO: Add a technologies section describing the technologies used
* TODO-Maybe: Add a history section explaining the origins

### To be implemented in prioritized order

1. **About page** `/about`
2. **Contact page** `/contact`
3. **Work page** `/hearttech`
4. **Work page** `/onthego`
5. **Work page** `/aisdw`

### Brainstorm and ideas

* Add some kind of list that show a list of technologies I've worked with. Upon clicking it shows links to work with that keyword associated

  * Utilizes the `PortfolioData` structure

* **Portfolio content**

  2. (Future) AIS Data warehouse (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python, ReactJS, (?) PygramETL, C#)
